# VIDEO-TO-ASCII-

The code was build on Python 3.9, so i assumme it should work for same version of Python or close to it.

Package you will need to run it:
- cv2		( pip install opencv-python )
- numpy 	( pip install numpy )

To run it, the code must be in the same directory (same folder). Open terminal with the directory of the video and
type "python test_video_v1.py" and it should run perfectly fine. However some tinkering is needed on the terminal to ensure 
it run smoothly.
