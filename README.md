# VIDEO-TO-ASCII-

The code was build on Python 3.9, so i assumme it should work for same version of Python or close to it.

Package you will need to run it:
- cv2		
```
pip install opencv-python
```
- numpy 	
```
pip install numpy
```

To run it, the code and the video must be in the same directory (same folder). 
```
C:\Users\AMD\Bad_Apple\example
```

Open terminal with the directory of the video and type "python test_video_v1.py".
```
C:\Users\AMD\Bad_Apple\example\python test_video_v1.py
```
Hold and behold it should run assuming that the requiments are filled.

However some tinkering is needed on the terminal to ensure it run smoothly.
